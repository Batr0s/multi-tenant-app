Transaction isolation is a key aspect of database management, defining how transactions interact in scenarios with concurrent changes. The isolation level setting ensures a delicate balance between performance optimization and maintaining the reliability and consistency of data operations.

## Decision Drivers

* Data consistency priority: emphasize the importance of maintaining a high level of consistency and reliability in data operations.

* Concurrency control requirements: underscore the necessity for effective concurrency control, ensuring that multiple transactions can execute concurrently without compromising data consistency.

* Row locking mechanisms: focus on the selection of row-level locking mechanisms as a key consideration.

## Considered Options

* REPEATABLE READ
* READ COMMITTED

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "REPEATABLE READ", the selection of this isolation level is driven by a main focus on data consistency, effective concurrency control, and the use of row-level locking mechanisms. This choice prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### REPEATABLE READ

* Good, because can guarantee the consistent reads within the same transaction, reading the snapshot established by the first read.
* Good, because for a unique index with a unique search condition, locking reads, update and delete statements locks only the index record.
* Good, because for other search conditions, it uses gap locks, minimizing the appearance of phantom rows.
* Bad, because locks can decrease the performance of the transactions.
* Bad, because increases the probability of deadlocks. 

### READ COMMITTED

* Good, because allows for improved concurrency by releasing locks immediately after the read operation, reducing contention.
* Good, because decrease the probability of deadlocks and improving overall transaction performance.
* Bad, because might result in non-repeatable reads, as changes made by other transactions during the same transaction are visible.
* Bad, because gap locking is disabled and might lead to phantom reads.
